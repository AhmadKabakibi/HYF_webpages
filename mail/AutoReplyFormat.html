    <p style="font-size:12.8px">Dear applicant of HackYourFuture,</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">First of all thank you for applying to our program. We’re very glad to see so many of
        you who want to&nbsp;educate&nbsp;themselves in&nbsp;web-development. We are&nbsp;very excited to get the
        program started.</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">Second of all, we’d like to explain you a bit about the&nbsp;selection process regarding
        the program.</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">In principle we want to have as much students as possible to enroll in the program. With
        the proposed program of HackYourFurture we&nbsp;endeavor to provide you&nbsp;possibilities for the near future
        to develop yourself. Our motivation is driven by our intrinsic care for people,</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">However, in order to be able to offer you a high quality course, we have certain
        requirements for our students. The most important one is that&nbsp;<b>we do need your English to be at quite a
            good level</b>. Learning how to program isn’t easy, but learning it in a language that you don’t understand
        well, &nbsp;will make it almost impossible to keep up with the program.</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">Secondly, in order to learn programming, its really important that you have&nbsp;<b>the
        time and the motivation</b>&nbsp;to learn. We require our students to study around&nbsp;<u>30 hours per week</u>,
        which is quite demanding. Furthermore, everybody who learns how to code will face a lot of problems when
        learning, and it will be frustrating at some times. It’s important to be determined about wanting to learn to
        code, in order to succeed in the program.</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">The following step in your application looks as follows:</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px"><b>Please send a&nbsp;</b><b>short</b><b>&nbsp;essay ( max. 300 words) in English in
        which you describe:</b></p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">1. Why do you want to learn programming and particularly web-development?</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">2. What would you like to build if you were are really good programmer?</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">(doesn’t have to be related to web-development, can be anything related to
        programming)</p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">You can now apply for the class that starts in September/October, by sending your essay to&nbsp;<b><a
            href="mailto:application@hackyourfuture.net" target="_blank">application@hackyourfuture.net</a>&nbsp;The deadline for this round is September 30th 23:59</span>.&nbsp;</b></p>
    <p style="font-size:12.8px">Please also send your CV if you have one.</p>
